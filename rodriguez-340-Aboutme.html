                        His name is Edwin Leos, he is the man in my life, and I admire him very much. If I were to describe him, I’d say he’s confident, genuine, and fair, with a strong sense of integrity and dependability. He’s a Certified Welding Inspector and even passed his certification on the first try! (This is a very hard test to pass on your first try, so don’t take it with a grain of salt.) Which really shows how focused and committed he is. At work, he approaches every inspection with care and precision, taking pride in doing things right and staying thorough no matter what the project.
                        He’s passionate about welding, staying active at the gym, and working with hands on projects. What really stands out to me is how he turns challenges into growth, he’s always learning, building, or pushing himself in some way. Outside of work, he values time with family, friends, and me, which helps him stay grounded and balanced. He loves being outdoors, staying active, and working on projects that keep him moving and focused.
                        One thing people might not notice right away is his loyalty and strong work ethic. He’s faced challenges early in life that taught him resilience and the importance of setting boundaries. His grandfather has been a huge influence on him, teaching him the value of hard work and a positive attitude, lessons he carries into everything he does.
                        Overall, he’s someone strong willed, dependable, and capable of achieving whatever he sets his mind to, but also thoughtful, kind, and grounded. He’s the kind of person who makes you feel like everything is in good hands, whether at work or in life.
